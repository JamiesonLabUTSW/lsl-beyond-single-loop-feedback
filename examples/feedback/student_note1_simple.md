Subjective:
History is clear, focused, and appropriately detailed. The student captured the typical progression of appendicitis with periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant and relevant associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Temporal features and severity are well described, and pertinent negatives like urinary or bowel symptoms are appropriately included. Social and family history are succinct but adequate. Could have strengthened the note by emphasizing aggravating and alleviating factors and including a more explicit review of systems, but overall this is a thorough and well-structured HPI.

Objective:
The physical exam is systematic and demonstrates understanding of key findings in appendicitis. Vital signs are specific and realistic. Description of abdominal findings, including guarding, rebound tenderness, and a positive Rovsing’s sign, supports a peritoneal process. The inclusion of general appearance and exclusion of CVA tenderness and jaundice shows broad thinking. Minor improvement could come from commenting on psoas or obturator signs to further support appendiceal irritation, but otherwise this is a strong and complete exam.

Diagnosis:
Primary diagnosis of acute appendicitis is well chosen and well supported by both subjective and objective findings. Differential diagnoses of gastroenteritis and mesenteric adenitis are reasonable alternatives given the overlapping features. However, the differentials could be expanded to include urinary or gynecologic causes for completeness. The hierarchy of likelihoods is appropriate and consistent with the presented evidence.

Justification:
The reasoning for appendicitis is logical, using key features such as migration of pain, localized RLQ tenderness, fever, and absence of urinary or bowel symptoms. The student demonstrates clear understanding of how the findings fit the diagnosis. However, the justifications for the alternative diagnoses are thin—gastroenteritis and mesenteric adenitis are mentioned without contrasting findings that make them less likely. Stronger reasoning would involve explicit differentiation rather than simple mention.

Plan:
Management plan is appropriate and reflects standard of care. The student prioritizes necessary labs, includes imaging with appropriate sequencing (ultrasound before CT), and emphasizes supportive measures like NPO status, IV fluids, and surgical consultation. The inclusion of antibiotics and perioperative considerations shows mature clinical reasoning. Could be improved by noting the need for serial abdominal exams and early communication with surgery, but overall this is a complete and evidence-based plan.
