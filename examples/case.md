## 🧠 **Key Points Student Should Cover**

### **History**

✅ Onset, migration of pain, character
✅ Associated anorexia, nausea, vomiting
✅ Fever
✅ Absence of urinary or bowel symptoms
✅ Gynecological history (if relevant)
✅ Exclude red flags (diarrhea, jaundice, bleeding)

### **Examination**

✅ Observation and general impression
✅ Abdominal inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation
✅ Appropriate special tests (Rovsing, psoas, rebound)
✅ Comments on vital signs and systemic review

### **Clinical Reasoning**

✅ Recognizes classical presentation (central → RLQ pain migration)
✅ Identifies likely **acute appendicitis**
✅ Mentions differential diagnoses appropriately

### **Initial Management Discussion**

* Keep **nil by mouth**
* Establish **IV access**, fluids, analgesia
* **Baseline labs:** FBC, CRP, U&E, pregnancy test (if applicable)
* **Imaging:** Ultrasound or CT if unclear diagnosis
* **Surgical referral** for appendectomy
* **Antibiotics** pre-operatively if confirmed
