## Objective

SECTION 1: VITAL SIGNS

1. Must include specific numbers; example: HR 98 bpm, BP 118/74 mmHg, T 38.2°C, RR 18 bpm

SECTION 2: GENERAL APPEARANCE

1. Appears uncomfortable, lying still in bed
2. Mild fever or flushed appearance may be noted

SECTION 3: ABDOMINAL EXAM

1. Inspection: abdomen not distended, minimal movement with respiration
2. Auscultation: normal bowel sounds
3. Percussion: tenderness over right lower quadrant, no organomegaly
4. Palpation:

   * Tenderness maximal at McBurney's point
   * Guarding and rebound tenderness present
   * Positive Rovsing's sign (pain in RLQ when LLQ pressed)
   * Possible positive psoas sign
5. Special tests: rebound tenderness or peritoneal irritation mentioned

SECTION 4: OTHER EXAM FINDINGS

1. No costovertebral angle tenderness
2. No jaundice or skin changes
3. No palpable masses

## Diagnosis

SECTION 1: Primary Diagnosis

1. Acute Appendicitis

SECTION 2: Differential Diagnoses

1. Gastroenteritis
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Meckel's diverticulitis
4. Urinary tract infection
5. Ectopic pregnancy (if female)

SECTION 3: Other Diagnoses

1. Renal colic
2. Inflammatory bowel disease flare

## Justification

SECTION 1: Appendicitis - Key Findings

1. Migration of pain from periumbilical to right lower quadrant
2. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting
3. Localized tenderness and guarding in RLQ
4. Fever (38.2°C)
5. Positive rebound tenderness and Rovsing's sign

SECTION 2: Appendicitis - Other Findings

1. No urinary or bowel symptoms
2. No prior abdominal surgery
3. No gynecologic symptoms

SECTION 3: Gastroenteritis - Key Findings

1. Diffuse abdominal pain
2. Diarrhea or multiple vomiting episodes (absent here)

SECTION 4: Mesenteric Adenitis - Key Findings

1. Recent viral infection or sore throat (absent here)
2. Diffuse tenderness without peritoneal signs

SECTION 5: UTI or Ectopic - Key Findings

1. Dysuria or urinary frequency (absent)
2. Menstrual irregularity (absent in this case)

## Plan

SECTION 1: Priority Diagnostics

1. Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for leukocytosis
2. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) or ESR for inflammation
3. Serum electrolytes, renal function
4. Urinalysis to rule out UTI
5. Pregnancy test (in all females of reproductive age)

SECTION 2: Imaging

1. Abdominal Ultrasound (especially in young or pregnant patients)
2. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast (if diagnosis unclear)

SECTION 3: Initial Management

1. Keep patient NPO (nothing by mouth)
2. IV fluids for hydration
3. IV analgesia and antiemetics
4. Surgical consult for appendectomy
5. Pre-operative antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporin + metronidazole)

SECTION 4: Follow-Up / Post-Op

1. Monitor vital signs and pain
2. Gradual reintroduction of diet after surgery
3. Wound care and infection prevention
